## Objectives

The objective for this project was to create a simple CRUD application (Create, Read, Update and Delete).

In this project i showcases my ability to:

- Show python skills to create a Functional CRUD application
- Create two databases with a one to many relationship
 - The use of Jenkins and pytest to test my application and provide a coverage report
 - Deploy my application using a VM (GCP)
<br>
<br>
<br>
## My Application

My application idea was to create a festival planner in which you can; 

- Enter a festival name
- Enter a festival start date
- Enter a festival end date
- Enter a stage names for the stated festival
- edit/update festival and stages
- Delete festivals and stages

This idea is a one to many relationship between two tables being one festival can have many stages but a stage can only belong to one festival. This table relationship can be displayed through an ERD (Entity relationship diagram)
